## 🎯 System Architecture

### **Security & Permissions**
```
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
✅ Permission-based access control
✅ User can only access their own appointments
✅ Instructors can manage their availability
✅ Admins have full system access
✅ Public access for availability browsing
```

### **Integration Points**
```
✅ Notification System - Automated reminders and confirmations
✅ User Identity System - Seamless user authentication
✅ Security Framework - Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Database Triggers - Real-time statistics updates
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User Request → API Validation → Service Layer → Database Functions → Response
     ↓                                  ↓
Security Check ←                    Notification Trigger
     ↓                                  ↓  
RLS Policy ←                       Analytics Update
```
